Worst-Case Big-O Notation discussed for each task


TASK 0:

Time Complexity - O(1) - Constant time; since the time is independent of the input

TASK 1:

Time Complexity - O(2n) - Linear time; 2 'for' loops on each of the input files, as these files get bigger time increases linearly with size

TASK 2:

Time Complexity - O(3n) - Linear time; 3 'for' loops, as the files get bigger time increases linearly with size

TASK 3: 

Time Complexity - O(3n) - Linear time; 3 'for' loops, as the files get bigger time increases linearly with size

TASK 4:

Time Complexity - O(4n) - Linear time; 4 'for' loops, as the files get bigger time increases linearly with size
