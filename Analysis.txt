Worst-Case Big-O Notation discussed for each task


TASK 0:

Time Complexity - O(1) - Constant time; since the time is independent of the input

TASK 1:

Time Complexity - O(2n) - Linear time; 2 'for' loops on each of the input files, as these files get bigger time increases linearly with size

TASK 2:

Time Complexity - O(3n) - Linear time; 3 'for' loops, as the files get bigger time increases linearly with size

TASK 3: 

Time Complexity - O(n logn) - n log n time; 2 'for' loops with complexity 'n'. 
Sorted function is used which has a time complexity of O(n logn), making the worst time complexity O(n logn). 
The total time complexity is (2n + nlog n)

TASK 4:

Time Complexity - O(n logn) - n logn time; 3 'for' loops with complexity 'n'. 
Sorted function is used which has a time complexity of O(n logn), making the worst time complexity O(n logn). 
The total time complexity is (3n + nlog n)
